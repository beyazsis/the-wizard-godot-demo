# the-wizard-godot-demo
Undertale like rpg game project developed in Godot
Game is 32x32 pixel but I also use 64x64, 128x128 pixel size textures.
You can run this game by selecting games root file in Godot's project manager.
Textures are created by me by using LibreSprite and Pixeloroma.


Its a demo. 

***Project is halted :(***
